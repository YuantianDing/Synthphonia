## Getting the Artifact

We provide a prebuilt Docker image for our artifact, available on our [Release Page](https://github.com/YuantianDing/Synthphonia/releases). This image allows you to run the artifact directly, without manually setting up all solvers.

### Building the Artifact Locally

If you prefer, you can build the docker image on your own machine using `artifact.zip`, which is also available on our [Release Page](https://github.com/YuantianDing/Synthphonia/releases). To do this, simply use the provided `Dockerfile`.

You can also manually compile all solvers by following the instructions below. For a more detailed guide, check the `Dockerfile`.

### Building Individual Solvers

- **Duet**: Install OPAM and the following packages: `z3.4.8.9`, `containers`, `containers-data`, `batteries`, `ocamlgraph`, and `sexplib`. Ensure compatibility with your OCaml compiler. **Note:** `python2` is required to build `z3.4.8.9`.
- **Probe**: Install JVM, `sbt`, and `cvc4`, then build using: `sbt assembly`.
- **FlashFill++**: Install [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) and run: `dotnet build`.
- **Synthphonia**: Follow the setup guide in the [Synthphonia repository](https://github.com/YuantianDing/Synthphonia).

To run the `test.py` script, you also need to install the required Python dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r text_utils/requirements.txt
```


## Files of the Artifact

The artifact consists of the following files and directories:

```py
artifact/
    benchmarks/       # 3 categories of benchmarks mentioned used in the paper
        duet/
        prose/
        hardbench/
    result_ref/       # Referential result in the paper.
    solvers/          # Source code or binaries (in the trimmed docker image) of the solvers
        duet/
        probe/
        prose/
        synthphonia/
    test_utils/       # A Python module required by `test.py`
    test.py           # The main script to run experiments
    Dockerfile        # Used to build docker image

    # To be generated
    result/           # Experimental results to be generated by `test.py run all`
        duet/         # Results for the Duet benchmarks
            cvc4/     # Results produced by the CVC4 solver
                ...   # JSON files containing benchmark execution results
            ...
        hardbench/    # Results for the Hardbench
        prose/        # Results for the Prose
    figures/          # Figures to be generated by `test.py draw`
```

## Run the tests

`test.py` provides a command to run/export/view the primary results from the paper. To run all the test, simply run `./test.py run all`, the result will be generated under `result` directory.

`test.py draw` will generate figures under `figures` directory, after all results are generated. 

```md
Usage: test.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  csv   Export results of a benchmark suite (duet, hardbench, prose) to csv
  draw  Draw figures in `figures` directory (Need all results collected)
  run   Run all benchmarks in a benchmark suite (all, duet, hardbench, prose)
  xlsx  Export results to xlsx
```
